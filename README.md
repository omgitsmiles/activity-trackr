# Acitivty Trackr

An application I wrote when I was coaching a friend during her marathon. It was intended to post workouts of the week and track results of the workout. Used typescript to write out this application

### Future Goals

- Create a full stack application that includes a log in for an athlete and coach
- Unique privileges for depenedent on if user is coach or athlete 
- back end would store the posted workouts by the coach as well as the results from the athlete and log in info
